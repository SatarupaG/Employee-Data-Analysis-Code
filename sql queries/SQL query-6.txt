- Find the active employees who worked in the organization on any given date but add a check using if statement for those without end dates (the problem here is that it counts every employee for every day)

SELECT dates.datekey, employees.startdate, 
IF(employees.enddate is null, "9999-12-31", employees.enddate) edate, employees.*
FROM employees CROSS JOIN dates
WHERE dates.datekey >= employees.startdate
AND (dates.datekey <= employees.enddate
OR employees.enddate is null)
